# Joystick Camera Control
A mod for Cities: Skylines to control the camera using an analog joystick.

Work in progress, mostly functional but UI needs some fixing.

Lets you choose from up to five axes to pan the camera (relative to screen or world), rotate, and zoom. Supports modifier keys. Should work with any USB joystick.
